<h1> Smart-Irrigation-System</h1>
<p></p>This project implements a smart irrigation system using IoT to automate and optimize plant watering. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi, soil moisture sensors, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and an MQTT protocol for remote monitoring and control of the irrigation process. The system reads real-time soil moisture levels and environmental data, controlling a water pump based on soil conditions or remote commands via MQTT.</p>

<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated watering based on soil moisture</li>
<li>Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and soil conditions</li>
<li>Remote control of the irrigation system via MQTT</li>
<li>Designed for easy integration with IoT platforms</li>
</ul>


<p>Hardware Required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>

<li>Soil Moisture Sensor</li>

<li>DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor</li>

<li>Relay Module for Water Pump</li>
