# Smart-Irrigation-System
This project implements a smart irrigation system using IoT to automate and optimize plant watering. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi, soil moisture sensors, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and an MQTT protocol for remote monitoring and control of the irrigation process. The system reads real-time soil moisture levels and environmental data, controlling a water pump based on soil conditions or remote commands via MQTT.

Key Features:

Automated watering based on soil moisture
Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and soil conditions
Remote control of the irrigation system via MQTT
Designed for easy integration with IoT platforms
Hardware Required:

Raspberry Pi
Soil Moisture Sensor
DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
Relay Module for Water Pump
